# My-network-automation
Some of my scripts for network automation. For the most part, these scripts were written independently, although some points were borrowed from open sources.

## Installation

Clone the repository from GitHub. Then create a virtual environment, and install all the dependencies. The dependencies for each script located in its header.

## Usage

Initialize the virtual environment, and run the script.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update the tests as appropriate.
